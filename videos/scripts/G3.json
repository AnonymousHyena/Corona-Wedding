{"text":"Heey,\n\nHere's how you can do mail merge with Gmail:\n\nInstall the Mail Merge for Gmail add-on. Please watch the Mail merge tutorial for instructions.\nThis will create a new Google Spreadsheet. Go to the Add-ons menu in the sheet, select Mail Merge with Attachments and then select the Create Merge Tempalte menu.\nOpen Google Contacts and create a new Group with all the contacts who you would like to send a personalized email. Alternatively, you can enter the names and email addresses of recipients directly in the Mail Merge Google Sheet.\nUnder the Mail Merge menu, choose Import Google Contacts and select the Google Contacts group that you created in Step 3. It will now automatically import all the associated Gmail contacts into the spreadsheet.\nGo to Gmail and create a new draft email messages that will become the template for Mail merge. Alternatively, you can compose an email template in rich text using the HTML Mail tool and then copy-paste the generated HTML code into the message body field of the Google Sheet.\nIf you would like to add file attachment to your email messages - say a PDF file or a Word document - just upload the file to Google Drive and then select Insert File Attachments to insert that link of the file into the Mail merge sheet. Mail Merge will automatically insert the actual file into the email.\nGo to the Mail Merge menu again and choose 'Configure Mail Merge' - the status column will change to 'MAIL SENT' for all email messages that were successfully delivered.\nIt is always a good idea to test your email campaign before sending a blast to multiple people. On the Configure Mail Merge screen, click the 'Send a Test Email' button and it will send a sample email to the developer with the {{Variable Fields}} substituted with dummy values. If all the fields have been replaced in the test email, your mail merge is ready to go._\n\nPeace & Love"}
